1️⃣ Install Java JDK
Download JDK 17 (LTS): Search “Download JDK 17” → install
2️⃣ Install Java Extension Pack in VS Code
Extensions → search Java Extension Pack → Install

Step 1: Open terminal inside VS Code -> Ctrl + `
You must be inside the same folder where file is saved.

Step 3: Compile the program ✅
javac OddNumbers.java
If no errors, it creates a file: OddNumbers.class

Step 4: Run the program ✅
java OddNumbers

----------------------------------------
? Can i use another way to run instead of 2 commands

🌟 Option 1: Run Button (Easiest)
VS Code shows a Run play button above main method.
It looks like: ▶️ Run | Debug
Just click ▶️ Run → DONE ✅
VS Code automatically:
Compiles
Runs
Prints output

🌟 Option 2: Right-click → Run Java
Right-click anywhere inside the editor:
Run Java


Then you can run from top-right play icon via Code Runner.

? how can i debug in vs code
 

1️⃣ Ensure you see the Run and Debug button
Install extensions (if not installed earlier):
Java Extension Pack
Debugger for Java

2️⃣ Set a Breakpoint
Click to the left of a line number
A red dot appears like a target 🎯
Example: set it inside your loop
if (i % 2 != 0) {
    System.out.println(i + " is odd"); // <-- CLICK HERE
}

3️⃣ Click Debug ▶️🐞
Above the main method:
▶ Debug

or press:
F5

VS Code will:

Pause the program exactly at your breakpoint

Show debugging tools at the top

4️⃣ Watch Variables Live
Open Run & Debug view:
Left sidebar → Bug icon 🐞
You will see:

Local variables (like i)

Their changing values every loop


You can also hover the mouse over variables to see values.

5️⃣ Step through code
Use these tiny toolbar buttons:
ButtonWhat it does⏭ Step OverMove to next line, stay in same function⤵ Step IntoGo inside method calls⏹ StopEnds debugging▶ ContinueJump to the next breakpoint
Try hitting Step Over repeatedly to watch numbers change.

🎉 Congrats: You’re officially debugging
Your odd numbers will reveal themselves one by one:
i = 1 → odd ✅ pause
i = 2 → skip
i = 3 → odd ✅ pause
…


🔥 Debug Powers You Unlock
✅ Pause anywhere
✅ Inspect variables
✅ Change values while debugging
✅ Find bugs with style
✅ Understand flow like a pro

If you like, I can give you a tiny next exercise:
Option A → Read a number from keyboard and debug
Option B → Find sum of odd numbers and debug
Option C → Debug a crashing program (fun chaos)
Option D → Your own idea
Pick one letter, and we continue leveling up! 🚀
